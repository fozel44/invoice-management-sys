# Invoice Management System

   This application is the public beta version of a project made to monitor the monthly invoicing processes of the managers and employees using the application via a     web interface.
 
   The administrator using the application can register new employees or users with different roles and authorizations to the system after logging in to her/his account.
   
   Employees, upload the document and details of the invoice they have issued to the system at the turn of the month.
   
   In this month, the manager issues an invoice to the company hired for that employee and enters the system in the same way.
   
   The system includes invoices as well as time sheets and allows SLA reporting.
